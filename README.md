# Car Insurance Claims Frequency Modelling Using Poisson Generalized Linear Models

ACST3061 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment modelled claim frequency for a car insurance portfolio using Poisson GLM with feature engineering, tree methods, boosting, and logistic regression for high claims. Included model selection via 10-fold CV.

## Key Tasks
- EDA and Poisson GLM fitting with linear/quadratic/mixed terms  
- Poisson regression tree and boosting (with/without base model)  
- Model comparison using 10-fold cross-validation error  
- Logistic regression for high claims indicator (N ≥ 2)  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Poisson GLM and generalized linear modelling  
- Regression trees, boosting, and ensemble methods  
- Cross-validation and model selection  
- Quantitative risk prediction for actuarial applications
